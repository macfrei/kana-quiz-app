# Kana Quiz App

Simple app created with [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) using React and TypeScript.

This app is an assignment which I received while job hunting. I was given a week to complete it.

I mainly focused on using **TypeScript** as this is only my second project to do so.

I also used **Vitest** to test some utility functions I wrote. Since I haven't used vite before, this was also new to me. _And I was blown away by how fast the tests were compared to using jest!_

I enjoyed working with these technologies!

The project looks best on mobile view as I developed it **mobile first**.

Please check out the [deployment of the project](https://kana-quiz-app.vercel.app/) and have fun testing your Hiragana and Katakana knowledge.
